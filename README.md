Finance-Calculator

This repository contains a Python script for a financial calculator capable of handling two main functions:

Investment Calculator: Calculate the future value of an investment considering both simple and compound interest.
Bond Calculator: Determine the monthly repayment on a bond/home loan based on the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment period.
Developed as my capstone project at HyperionDev, this tool emphasizes readability and user interaction, providing clear prompts and easy-to-understand results. It's a practical application blending core financial concepts with Python programming.
